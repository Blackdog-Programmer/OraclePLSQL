Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM <table name>;
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	--Incase primary key: primary keys are always distinct and is not null by primary key constraint
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM <table name>;

	--Incase foregin key
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT <foregin key>)
	FROM <table name>;

i. Business = 10000(id: primary key)
ii. Hours = 1562(business_id: foregin key)
iii. Category = 2643(business_id: foregin key)
iv. Attribute = 1115(business_id: foregin key)
v. Review = 10000(id: primary key), 8090(business_id: foregin key), 9581(user_id: foregin key)
vi. Checkin = 493(business_id: foregin key)
vii. Photo = 10000(id: primary key), 6493(business_id: foregin key)
viii. Tip = 537(user_id: foregin key), 3979(business_id: foregin key)
ix. User = 10000(id: primary key)
x. Friend = 11(user_id: foregin key)
xi. Elite_years = 2780(user_id: foregin key)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: 0
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	--user table has 20 columns
	--number in where conditions is each column number
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM user
	WHERE 1 IS NULL OR 2 IS NULL OR 3 IS NULL OR 4 IS NULL OR 5 IS NULL OR 6 IS NULL OR 7 IS NULL OR 8 IS NULL OR 
		  9 IS NULL OR 10 IS NULL OR 11 IS NULL OR 12 IS NULL OR 13 IS NULL OR 14 IS NULL OR 15 IS NULL OR 
		  16 IS NULL OR 17 IS NULL OR 18 IS NULL OR 19 IS NULL OR 20 IS NULL;

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT MIN(<column name>), MAX(<column name>), AVG(<column name>)
	FROM <table name>;
	
	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1.0	max: 5.0	avg: 3.6549
		
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.0144
		
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.9414
		
	
	v. Table: User, Column: Review_count
	
		min: 0		max: 2000	avg: 24.2995
		


5. List the cities with the most reviews in descending order:

	FROM business
	GROUP BY city
	ORDER BY SUM(review_count);

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	--https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/r-squared.asp
	SELECT AVG((review_count - avg_x) * (fans - avg_y)) * 
		   AVG((review_count - avg_x) * (fans - avg_y) ) / (var_x*var_y) as R_Square
	FROM user, (SELECT avg_x, avg_y,
					AVG((review_count - avg_x) * (review_count - avg_x)) as var_x, 
					AVG((fans - avg_y) * (fans - avg_y)) as var_y 
				FROM user, (SELECT AVG(review_count) as avg_x, 
								   AVG(fans) as avg_y 
							FROM user)
				);
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
	+----------------+
	|       R_Square |
	+----------------+
	| 0.437136492915 |
	+----------------+
	
	Following the result of R_Square. review and fans are partly correlated.
	
	
	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: NO. As previous answerd the problem 1.ix there are 10000 tuples in the review table.
			1958 < 5000, so there less reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT COUNT(*)
	FROM review
	WHERE text LIKE '%love%' OR text LIKE '%hate%';

	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
	+----------+
	| COUNT(*) |
	+----------+
	|     1958 |
	+----------+
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
	SELECT *
	FROM user
	ORDER BY fans DESC
	LIMIT 10;
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
